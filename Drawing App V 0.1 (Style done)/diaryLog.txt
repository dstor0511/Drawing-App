CSS changes, I'm trying to alter the side bar design. Having some issues with the canvas, something altred it's size, still dont know what it is. 
Trying to solve it going line by line. 

#sidebar {
    Move no. 1: Alter the width and the heigh of the side bar. Canvas still works. DONE. 
    Move no. 2: Rounded corners of the side bar. Canvas still works. DONE. 
    Move no. 3: Alter the positon of the side bas. Canvas still works. DONE. 
    Move no. 4: Don't add padding to the side bar. Canvas still works. DONE.
        These lines were deleted
        padding-top: 5px;
	    padding-left: 10px;
};

#content {
    No changes made. Canvas still works. DONE.
}; 

.header {
    Move no. 1: Attempt to change the font (Verdana), but still is usign sans-serfi. Need to change it. 
    Move no. 2: Make round corners to 5px
    Move no. 3: Font type and name updated to type: Verdana, text: dibujo
    
}

.wrapper {
    I was playing aroung with the grids and updated this line of code:
    /*grid-template-columns: 70px 230px  minmax(500px, 1fr);*/
	  
    To this. Still trying to work out how to handle the color palat in the right place without damaging the canvas. Since the color palete depends on  the columns. 
    grid-template-columns: 70px 1046px;
}
Day end.

Move no. 1:

    Start by changing the top bar design
    Update the buttons. In the HTML file I will update the text and replace it with an image. Source of info (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8683528/embed-image-in-a-button-element)
    Replace this line of code:
        <button id="clearButton">Clear</button>
    With this:
        <button id="clearButton"><img src="assets/clearScreen.png"></button>
        That didnt worked the way I expected because the image is over the button and is not the button, hence its height and width are not adjustable. 
    Try again this in the style sheet. 
        In the style sheet I modified most of the properties of the button. 
        The HTML of the button remained the same, but the CSS changed. These lines of code were added. 
        This is button style:
        #clearButton{
            width: 30px;
            height: 30px;
            border-style: none;
            border-radius: 2px;
            background-color: white;
            position: relative;
            top: 2px;
            left: 145px;
            background-image: url(Icons/restart.png);
            background-size: contain;
        }

        This is hover over button background color change
        #clearButton:hover{
            background-color: aqua;
        }
Move no. 2:

    - Repeat the same process as before for the download button.
    
    - Change the design of the header, the header is now looking like this:
        .header {
            grid-area: header;
            font-family: Verdana;
            border-radius: 5px;
            width: 300px;
            position: relative;
            left: 5px;
            top: 3px;
        }
    
    - Attempt to change the design of the text in the <div> but I was unable to do so. Save my work and continue later
    
    - Delete the text in the HTML div, and create a <h3> tag in the div
        After adding the h3 to the div and adjusting its properites in the CSS file I started moving the buttons.
        The heading is appearing below the desired position.
    - Ater adding the desired title in the correct position I then adjusted the widht of it, since it was messing up the buttons. 
    - Finally adjusted the hover over buttons to rgb (200, 200, 200);
